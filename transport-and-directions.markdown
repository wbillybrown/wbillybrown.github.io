#### By Bus 

Stagecoach in Fife offer a number of routes around St Andrews via the 99 services, as well as routes that go through nearby towns and villages.

#### By Car

Since St Andrews is a small but popular town, parking is quite limited, so parking in town might be difficult.

North Street, where St Salvator's Chapel is, has plenty of on street parking, which is free between Younger Hall and the cathedral ruins, and can therefore get quite busy. The Scores, behind the chapel, has additional parking, and there is a small car park on North Street near Ziggy's restaurant. Most street parking is metered. Rufflets has free parking available.

Larger, free car parks are available on the edges of town on the North Haugh and by West Sands.
